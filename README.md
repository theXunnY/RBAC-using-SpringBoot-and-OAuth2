# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with OAuth2, Spring Security, and Spring Boot  

This project implements a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system using OAuth2 for authentication and authorization. It leverages Spring Security and Spring Boot to ensure secure and scalable access to application resources based on user roles.  

---

## üöÄ Features  

### üîí Authentication with OAuth2  
- Secure user authentication using OAuth2.  
- Support for multiple OAuth2 grant types (e.g., Authorization Code, Password).  
- Stateless token-based session management with JWT.  

### üõ°Ô∏è Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Define roles such as `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, and `USER`.  
- Enforce role-specific permissions at API and method levels.  
- Assign and manage user roles dynamically.  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Spring Security Integration  
- Fine-grained access control using Spring Security.  
- Annotation-based method security (`@PreAuthorize`, `@Secured`).  
- Easy-to-configure security rules for protected resources.  

### üîó API Protection  
- Secure REST APIs with role-specific access rules.  
- Token validation for all API requests.  
- Role-based filtering of sensitive data.  

### üë§ User Management  
- Admin capabilities for managing users and roles.  
- APIs for user registration, authentication, and profile updates.  

### üìà Scalable and Secure Design  
- Modular architecture for easy addition of new roles and permissions.  
- Best practices for secure and maintainable application development.

## üìã Project Workflow  

1. **Set Up OAuth2 Authorization Server:**  
   - Configure the project as an OAuth2 authorization server or integrate it with an external provider like Keycloak or Okta.  

2. **Implement Resource Server:**  
   - Secure APIs by setting up a resource server to validate access tokens.  

3. **Define Roles and Permissions:**  
   - Create a database schema to manage users, roles, and their relationships.  
   - Populate roles like `ADMIN`, `USER`, and others as needed.  

4. **Configure Security Rules:**  
   - Use Spring Security to define role-based access control for APIs.  

5. **Develop REST APIs:**  
   - Build APIs for login, registration, and role management.  
   - Protect each endpoint with role-specific access rules.  

6. **Testing and Deployment:**  
   - Test authentication, authorization, and role-based access.  
   - Deploy the application using Docker or cloud platforms.

## üîë How to Run the Project  

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/rbac-oauth2-springboot.git
   cd rbac-oauth2-springboot

2. **Setup the Database:**  
   Configure the database connection in application.yml or application.properties.
   
  
3. **Build and Run:**   
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run


## üõ°Ô∏è Security Rules
 - Add support for social login (Google, Facebook, etc.).
 - Implement role hierarchy for advanced access control.
 - Introduce audit logging for tracking user actions.
